# technical-documentation-page

## Project Description 📝

> This is a simple echnical documentation page created as part of a web development learning project. I had a lot of trouble while coding my project, not because it's too difficult, because it's my first time coding and I'm learning how to build a website.
In this project, I wrote about the ethnic groups of Afghanistan. Certainly, in terms of content, the topics are not chosen correctly and there are problems, but this is an educational project and the form is important in it, not its content.
