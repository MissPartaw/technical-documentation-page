      <p>Afghanistan is a multiethnic and mostly tribal society. The population of the country consists of numerous ethnolinguistic groups: mainly the <code>Pashtun</code>, <code>Tajik</code>, <code>Hazara</code>, and <code>Uzbek</code>, as well as the minorities of Aimaq, Turkmen, Baloch, Pashai, Nuristani, Gujjar, Brahui, Qizilbash, Pamiri, Kyrgyz, Sadat, Mongol and others. Altogether they make up the Afghan people.</p>
      <p>The former Afghan National Anthem and the Afghan Constitution (before 2021) each mention fourteen of them.</p>

    <section id="Hazara_Tribe" class="main-section">
      <header>Hazara Tribe</header>
      <p>The Hazaras are one of the largest ethnic groups in Afghanistan. They reside in all parts of Afghanistan, mainly in the Hazarajat region in central Afghanistan. Linguistically the Hazaras speak the <code>Dari</code> and <code>Hazaragi</code> dialects of the Persian language. Dari is the official language of Afghanistan and Hazaragi is closely related to the Dari which sometimes their variant is interspersed with many Turkic and a few Mongolic words. They practice Islam, mostly the Shi'a, with significant and almost large Sunni, and some Isma'ili. According to Library of Congress Country Studies in 1996, Hazaras made up 18% of the country's population, while more recent estimates vary between 9 and 12%.</p>

    <section id="Pashtun_Tribe" class="main-section">
      <header>Pashtun Tribe</header>
      <p>The Pashtuns make up the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan. The exact numbers vary; according to the Library of Congress Country Studies' estimate of 1996, Pashtuns made up 40%, according to other estimates from around the 2000s around 60% of Afghanistan's population. More recent estimates vary between 42% in 2013 and 52.4% in 2023. The majority of Pashtuns practice <code>Sunni Islam</code>. After the rise of the Hotaki dynasty in 1709 and the Durrani Empire in 1747, Pashtuns expanded by forming communities in what is now Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p>
      <p>There are conflicting theories about the origin of the Pashtun people, both among historians and the Pashtun themselves. A variety of ancient groups with eponyms similar to <code>Pukhtun</code> have been hypothesized as possible ancestors of modern Pashtuns. The Greek historian Herodotus mentioned a people called Pactyans, living in the Achaemenid's Arachosia Satrap as early as the 1st millennium BC. Since the 3rd century AD and onward they are mostly referred to by the ethnonym "Afghan", a name believed to be given to them by neighboring Persian people. Some believe that ethnic Afghan is an adaptation of the Prakrit ethnonym Avagana, attested in the 6th century CE. It was used to refer to a common legendary ancestor known as "Afghana", asserted to be grandson of King Saul of Israel.</p>
      <p>Other Pashtun clans, which are among the important groups and clans of the Pashtun people include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Nurzai</li>
        <li>Zadran</li>
        <li>Durrani</li>
        <li>Ahmadzai</li>
        <li>Statankzai</li>
        <li>Shinwar</li>
        <li>etc...</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="Tajik_Tribe" class="main-section">
      <header>Tajik Tribe</header>
      <p>Tajiks form the second-largest ethnic group in Afghanistan. While it is estimated that they make up about 27% of the population as of 2013, they made up 25.3% of Afghanistan's population in 1996, and the Encyclopædia Britannica explains that by the early 21st century they constituted about one-fifth (i.e., 20%) of the population. They are a native <code>Persian-speaking</code> people. As a self-designation, the term Tajik, which earlier on had been more or less pejorative, has become acceptable only during the last several decades, particularly as a result of Soviet administration in Central Asia. Alternative names for the Tajiks are <code>Fārsī</code> (Persian), <code>Fārsīwān</code> (Persian-speaker), and <code>Dīhgān</code> (cf. Tajik: Деҳқон, romanized: Dehqon, literally "farmer or settled villager", in a wider sense "settled" in contrast to "nomadic").</p>
      <p>Tajiks are the major ethnic group in neighboring Tajikistan, a country that was created north of Afghanistan in 1991. During the late 19th century and early 20th century, large numbers of Central Asian Tajiks fled the conquest of their native homeland by the Russian Red Army and settled in northern Afghanistan.</p>

    <section id="Ozbek_Tribe" class="main-section">
      <header>Ozbek Tribe</header>
      <p>The Uzbeks are one of the main Turkic ethnic groups in Afghanistan, whose native territory is in the northern regions of the country. Most likely the Uzbeks migrated with a wave of Turkic invaders and intermingled with local Iranic tribes over time to become the ethnic group they are today. The Uzbeks of Afghanistan are predominantly <code>Sunni Muslims</code> and fluent in <code>Southern Uzbek</code>. Uzbeks living in Afghanistan were estimated in the 1990s at approximately 1.3 million but are believed to be 2 million in 2011.</p>

    <section id="National_identity" class="main-section">
      <header>National identity</header>
      <p>The term "Afghan" is synonymous with the ethnonym "Pashtun", but in modern times the term became the national identity of the people, who live in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>The national culture of Afghanistan is not uniform, at the same time, the various ethnic groups have no clear boundaries between each other and there is much overlap. Additionally, ethnic groups are not racially homogenous. Ethnic groups in Afghanistan have adopted traditions and celebrations from each other and all share a similar culture. For example, <code>Nauruz</code> is a New Year festival celebrated by various ethnic groups in Afghanistan.</p>
